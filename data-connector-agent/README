Prerequisites:

You must install the Google Protocol Buffer compiler and make sure its in the path.  It can be 
downloaded here:

  - follow the README to install.
  - We include the generated protocol buffer classes should protoc not be available.

1) sh configure.sh.

Options:
    --lsb) use LSB defaults no other PREFIX options are neccessary
    --prefix) binary prefix
    --etcprefix) etc prefix.  defaults to /usr/local/etc

Generally only --prefix, The rest is for tuning to your platform.
