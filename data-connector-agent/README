= Secure Data Connector Install Instructions for GNU/Linux or Cygwin

Prerequisites:

You must install the Google Protocol Buffer compiler and make sure its in the
path.  It can be downloaded from here:
  - http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/downloads/list
  - follow the README to install.
  - We include the generated protocol buffer classes should protoc be
    unavailable.

1) bash configure.sh.

Options:
    --prefix) General installation prefix.
              Normally the majority of the files are tucked away under
              /opt/google/secure-data-connector/${version}; but some of them
              respect tenets of the FHS and LSB, so they are installed under
              /etc/init.d, /etc/opt/google/secure-data-connector/${version}, and
              /var/opt/google/secure-data-connector/${version}/{lib,log,run}.
    --by_prefix_only) Force all installation paths to follow the --prefix
                      designation.  If --prefix is '', then prefix becomes ./.
    --sysconfdir) The configuration file storage location.  This defaults to
                  /etc/opt/google/secure-data-connector/${version}
    --localstatedir) A place for read-write operations to occur and persistent
                     storage.  This defaults to
                     /var/opt/google/secure-data-connector/${version}.
    --bindir) A place for binary files to go.  This defaults to ${PREFIX}/bin.
    --libdir) A place for library files to go.  This defaults to ${PREFIX}/lib.
    --user) A username for the daemon to run as.  This defaults to daemon.
    --group) A group for the daemon to run as.  The defaults to daemon.
    --javahome) system java location. Will look in the default path too.

Generally only --prefix, The rest is for tuning to your platform.

2) ant

This compiles all the source into jars.

3) ant install

This installs to the locations specified when configure.sh was run.

4) edit your PREFIX/etc/localConfig.xml and PREFIX/etc/resourceRules.xml files to add rules

Other useful targets:

1) ant dist-clean (returns to original downloaded state)
2) ant clean (returns to prebuilt but configured state)
