The Google FeedServer is an open-source Atom Publishing provider based on the 
Abdera Framework. Google FeedServer implements simple backend data
adapters that allow the developer to quickly deploy a feed for an existing 
data source such as a database. The FeedSever makes it easy to create these 
adapters.
