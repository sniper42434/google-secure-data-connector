The ant build.xml in this directory allows one to build both debian 
packages and RPMs for the secure data connector.  It builds them 
assuming the --lsb option and locations for the dependent RPMs.

This script is brittle and currently only works easily on Ubuntu Hardy
for the debian packages. 

TODO(rayc) Fill in RPM details when Darrell returns.
